# Dropped_Frames_Checker

The idea of this program will be to break a video down into a series of images, then see if any images have an idential image next to them, which shows a dropped frame.

So if Frame(n) is the same as Frame(n+1) then that will be a dropped frame

This is being created at request, as we work with a lot of redered footage at work, and this will speed up QA
